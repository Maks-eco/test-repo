# App for generation video from an image
App created for testing some features. It may work on the front side, and server side, and mix both of them. The final video looks like cell divisions. Download, try, and make fun.

For working with the server side, please install all requirements for the 'videoshow' module from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/videoshow).
